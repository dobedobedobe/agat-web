## When visitors enter the virtual exhibition, they find themselves inside a Petri dish, symbolizing the microscopic nature of typhoid. From there, they embark on a journey through time and space, guided by NPCs (non-player characters) and interactive objects. As they navigate the 8-bit world of Bangalore, they explore different areas representing various periods, starting from the pre-colonial era with its temples and goddess worship, moving through colonial Bangalore, and finally reaching modern times.

The exhibition seamlessly blends educational content with gamified elements. Visitors interact with objects, engage in conversations, and uncover the narrative of typhoid's impact on the city. Along the way, they learn about the bacteria, its spread, and the historical and social contexts that influenced the city's response to the epidemic. The platform used, Gather Town, allows for guided tours by mediators, creating an interactive and collaborative experience for groups of visitors.

##### The juxtaposition of the 8-bit character exploration in an 8-bit world with the hand-drawn sketches of real buildings adds a unique and visually captivating aspect to the exhibition. This combination of styles creates a contrast that enhances the immersive experience. By gamifying the exhibition and utilizing Gather Town's tools, we successfully transformed a traditional museum experience into a dynamic and engaging virtual journey through time, space, and the history of typhoid in Bangalore.
