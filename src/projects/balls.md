projctx: Imagine a world where a renowned poet, known for their activism and
  ability to challenge governments, suddenly goes missing. This captivating
  premise sets the stage for our virtual theatre project, "The Last Poet." In
  the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, theatre-maker Amitesh Grover aimed to
  recreate the live theatre experience for a global audience while navigating
  the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Thus, "The Last Poet" was born—an
  extraordinary web-based performance and an early foray into what is now known
  as the metaverse, providing a tantalising glimpse into the future of immersive
  storytelling. Through the voices of the poet's acquaintances—neighbours,
  publishers, and other characters—we embark on a journey to unravel the mystery
  behind their disappearance.

## T﻿HE ATMOSPHERE

As the audience enters our virtual theatre, they encounter a visually stunning and ever-changing space. The generative algorithm that forms the foundation of the virtual environment ensures that each visit unveils a unique visual experience. Within this mesmerizing whirlwind of rooms and floating boxes, the audience is transported to different points in the space, creating a sense of exploration and discovery.

## T﻿HE STORYLINES

The heart of the experience lies in the interconnected storylines presented by different characters. Regardless of the order in which the audience engages with the performers' virtual live rooms, they are guaranteed a complete and meaningful experience. Each user's journey is carefully designed to offer a different perspective on the lost poet's story. With approximately 125 possible user journeys, the audience embarks on a personalised adventure, seamlessly transitioning between the diverse characters' narratives.

## T﻿HE INTERACTIVITY

Throughout the performance, the audience actively participates through a live voting feature. The director engages the viewers by posing questions that determine the path the characters take. This dynamic interaction reinforces the live nature of the experience, ensuring it feels immersive and authentic. By incorporating thematic sound elements and short films into the web-based environment, we create a multi-dimensional experience that blurs the boundaries between traditional theatre and virtual reality.

## C﻿ONCLUSION

This virtual theatre project not only pushed the boundaries of technology but also provided a unique cultural and artistic experience. By seamlessly integrating design, production, and technology, we embraced the challenge of bringing this complex and captivating narrative to life on every kind of internet-enabled device and yet provided an experience that transcends traditional screen-based viewing.
