*Sir David Attenborough wanders in a toxic landscape with weird mutant species while he is shooting his latest nature documentary.*

The spectator is invited to watch Sir David Attenborough's latest documentary set in a remote area in the cotton growing region of Central India. Here new forms of nature are emerging, due to the use of agrochemicals and pesticides: evolution at light speed. Only the installation doesn't show the usual spectacular cinematic imagery we associate with his documentaries. In the darkened space we solely hear his whispering voice accompanied by a dramatic cinematic score that conjures up our imaginations of the Wild. Parallelly we see the story of the documentary crew unfold on the large screen where their voices appear as graphic textual elements.

The use of AI to generate David Attenborough's voice creates an uncanny space where truth is traded for believability. This hopefully opens up an uncanny space where we can doubt and question the colonial and extractive dimension of mediatisation of nature.

The mode of spectatorship proposed by the installation creates a need for a deeper listening and an invitation to imagine what nature could be. It is at the same time a research into the machinations of Attenborough's global blockbusters. How he has risen since 1950's to the status of popular science's darling, the voice of reason and more recently advocate for change in the fight against climate change. What happens if one were to appropriate such a powerful voice through an AI text-to-speech model? What can we learn about the scaffolding that holds up this impressive British voice when we employ this artistic strategy of appropriation? How does this voice tell truths and undoubtable facts? A﻿nd what happens if we stage the exotic natural sites shown in BBC's science based documentaries as sites of speculation? What kind of stories and knowledges fall outside of the purview of the conventional science discovery narratives.

Made as Intimidation Tactics with Naomi Collier Broms, Computational Mama, George Demetriou, Julia van der Putten

A﻿ first audio only version of the work was presented at Future Fantastic Festival 2023 in Bangalore, India.
