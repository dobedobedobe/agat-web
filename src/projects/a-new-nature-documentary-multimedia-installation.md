*Sir David Attenborough wanders in a toxic landscape with weird mutant species while he is shooting his latest nature documentary. This multimedia installation uses AI image manipulation and AI voice generation. It explores the emergence of new forms of nature. Narrated by the distinct whispering voice of Sir David Attenborough, generated using an AI text-to-speech model.*

The multimedia installation is a collection of speculative narrations in the AI generated voice of renowned BBC presenter, Sir David Attenborough. The audience experiences fragments of his voice in the absence of the typical imagery we associate with his documentaries. This mode of spectatorship creates a need for a deeper listening and an invitation to imagine what nature could be. Sir David Attenborough is presented as a narrator of his upcoming documentary about landscapes that have been permanently altered due to the use of agrochemicals and pesticides. In these landscapes a new form of nature is emerging and Sir David Attenborough with his BBC crew are the first to bring this to the world. He is made to call it "the birth of a New Nature" in this film

The use of AI to generate David Attenborough's voice creates an uncanny space where truth is traded for believability. This hopefully opens up an uncanny space where we can doubt and question the colonial and extractive dimension of mediatisation of nature.
