*Come sit on my face one last time is a concert, set within the context of the cotton farming crisis in India. S﻿ince the 1990's the largest wave of recorded suicides has taken place in the Indian farming community. Over 400,000 farmers have killed themselves. This is reflected in the tragic statistical truth that, 'Every 30 minutes a farmer kills themselves in India.' During the performance we investigate the meaning of this statistical expression and witness what it means for us to live in a world where farmers are left with no choice but to consider their own death.*

The work is set up in the form of a techno-synth pop concert about the future of nature and the human-race that lasts exactly 30 minutes. What does it mean to share this temporality with the farmer? In which way can we locate ourselves in relation to this crisis? This is not an attempt to propose a solution to the crisis. This is not a call to action. It is not a commentary or an explanation. At best it is an attempt to digest what we already know is true, it is a forecasting, a mythical prophecy from the deep past and near future.
