Birth of Cotton is an archive of a two year research into the Indian cotton crisis by Intimidation Tactics. The crisis entails the largest recorded wave of suicides in the world: since 1995 over 400.000 farmers have taken their own lives. Many of  them are cotton farmers. How the fuck did we end up here? 

The grid of pages comprising this archive traces the research into the cotton crisis while also delving into the practices used to translate this phenomenon to the stage. These practices include acts of speculation, mythmaking, storytelling, vocal experimentation and poetry. Visitors are invited to wander, read, and draw connections between this wide variety of material. 

R﻿esearch: Agat Sharma and Julia van der Putten

C﻿uration: Naomi Collier Broms and Julia van der Putten
