*They Do Not Move And Other Misunderstandings is an unapologetic and irreverent adaptation of Samuel Beckettâ€™s Waiting for Godot. The play is divided into three strands, a real experience of waiting, a representation of waiting and theorisation of Beckettian archetypes.* 

The play is a non-understanding of the original text and admits its inability to comprehend the original text at the onset of the piece. The highlights of the play are the 10 Attributes of the Beckettian Body sequence and the Waiting for Godot Interpretation generator bot.
