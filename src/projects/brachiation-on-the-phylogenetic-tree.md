*Brachiation on the Phylogenetic Tree* begins in the gallery with a call-to-action: using your mobile to phone the toll-free number stenciled across the gallery wall. The conspicuously displayed phone number is a reference to the cost-effective advertising campaigns often found on the hoardings of building sites in many Indian cities. 

When audiences call the toll-free number, they are greeted by a welcome message that leads them into an imaginary space, quite unlike the false service promises of a typical automated Call Centre system. As the caller selects options, each choice made forks the narrative path. The caller takes on the role of a writer entering his own archive, invited to explore the worlds of twelve species of microorganisms ranging from fungi to Tardigrades. 

In the archive fragments of narrative material is scattered; fragments about microorganisms that shine like stars in petri dishes, and those that stink like the rotten depths of our worst imagined hell. Dialling into Brachiation on the Phylogenetic Tree is an invitation to twist together delicate narrative strands weaving your own story.
