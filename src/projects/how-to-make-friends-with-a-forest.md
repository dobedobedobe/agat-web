*How To Make Friends With A Forest?* is performed in the form of a drawing class that requires participants to hide inside a forest in order to understand its complex processes and observe its layered ecology. A group of 15 young participants enter a reserved forest area, without any permission and drew 100 illustrations in the next seven days. A series of negotiations between the human and non-human unfolded.
