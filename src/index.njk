In 2022 he founded Intimidation Tactics (I_T), a post-critical theatre collective with no regard for disciplinary boundaries. Under this name he continues to work in relation to the context in India and continues to collaborate with practitioners who live in India as well as newfound collaborators in the Netherlands. </p>
